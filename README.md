## üë®‚Äçüî¨ üî¨ Chemistry Student | Exploring the Power of Code

I'm a chemistry student who started this journey with just basic Python skills, learning how coding can make science more accessible. I want to create tools that are useful for the chemistry community and bring new ideas to the field.

Instead of waiting until I felt ‚Äúready,‚Äù I decided to learn by experimenting with AI tools, which introduced me to programming and helped me along the way. Putting aside the ethical debates around AI, I think we can all agree that time is valuable. The more we integrate AI into research, the better we can solve problems in new and innovative ways.

Energy is a state of infinite being! üöÄ


**Interests:** Cold atoms, superconductors, quantum mechanics  
**Learning:** Coding for chemistry community & open-source projects

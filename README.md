## 👨‍🔬 🔬 Chemistry Student | Exploring the Power of Code

I'm a chemistry student learning how coding can help make scientific knowledge more accessible. I want to build tools that are actually useful for the chemistry community and hopefully contribute something meaningful to the field.  

I started with just basic Python skills, but instead of waiting until I felt “ready,” I decided to learn by doing—experimenting, making mistakes, and using AI tools like ChatGPT and Blackbox to figure things out. The more we integrate AI into research, the more we can streamline problem-solving and discovery.  

Sky is the limit! 🚀

**Interests:** Cold atoms, quantum mechanics  
**Learning:** Coding for chemistry community & open-source projects

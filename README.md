## 👨‍🔬 🔬 Chemistry Student | Exploring the Power of Code

I'm a chemistry student currently exploring how coding can make scientific knowledge more accessible. My goal is to create useful tools for the chemistry community and contribute to innovation in the field!

I started with only beginner-level Python knowledge but decided to learn by actively engaging with AI models like ChatGPT and Blackbox. I believe that the more we adapt to AI-driven scripts, the more we can harness its potential for research and problem-solving. 

Sky is the limit! 🚀

**Interests:** Cold atoms, quantum mechanics  
**Learning:** Coding for chemistry community & open-source projects
